title: dApp Integration

<Callout type="info">
	If you are using `dapp-kit`, you do not need to install any additional packages to integrate with
	the Slush wallet. [Read how to integrate with dapp-kit.](../dapp-kit/slush)
</Callout>

Using the Slush Wallet SDK, you can allow users to connect to the Slush wallet from your dApp. The
wallet is provided through the [Wallet Standard](https://docs.sui.io/standards/wallet-standard), and
should appear automatically in your existing wallet connection UI.

<Callout>
	The Slush Wallet SDK is only needed if you want to support the Slush web wallet in your dApp. If
	you want to integrate with the Slush browser extension or native mobile wallet, you do not need to
	install any additional packages - they will work automatically through the Wallet Standard.
</Callout>

## Considerations

- Users will only be able to connect their zkLogin wallet from Slush.
- The zkLogin account will be managed by Slush, you do not need to set up any OAuth providers.
- You will not get access to the user's private key, you will only be able to connect to the wallet,
  and suggest transactions and messages to sign, just like any other wallet in the ecosystem.

## Setup

To use the Slush wallet, you will need to register it in your application, using
`registerSlushWallet`. This only needs to be done once, and should be done as early as possible in
your application's lifecycle.

`registerSlushWallet` takes two arguments:

- `name`: The name of your dApp. This will be shown to the user when they are asked to approve the
  connection in Slush.
- `options`: An optional object with the following properties:
  - `origin`: The origin of the Slush website. Defaults to `https://getslush.com`.
  - `network`: The network that you would like the Slush wallet to use. Defaults to `mainnet`,
    supports `mainnet` and `testnet`.

```ts
import { registerSlushWallet } from '@mysten/slush-wallet';

registerSlushWallet('Your dApp Name');
```

## Supported features

The Slush wallet currently supports the following features:

- `signTransaction`
- `signAndExecuteTransaction`
- `signPersonalMessage`

## Detecting the Slush wallet

If you'd like to detect whether the user is connected to the Slush wallet, you can use the `id` or
`name` property on the wallet

For example, if you are using `dapp-kit`, you can use the `useCurrentWallet` hook to get the current
wallet, and check if it is the Slush wallet.

```ts
import { useCurrentWallet } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
import { SLUSH_WALLET_NAME } from '@mysten/slush-wallet';

function SlushOnly() {
	const { currentWallet } = useCurrentWallet();
	const walletIsSlushWallet = currentWallet?.name === SLUSH_WALLET_NAME;

	// rest of component logic...
}
```

## Migration from Stashed Wallet -> Slush Wallet

If you're currently using `@mysten/zksend`'s `registerStashedWallet` directly, you should migrate to
the `@mysten/slush-wallet` package to ensure compatibility with the new Slush experience.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pnpm install @mysten/slush-wallet
```

## üîÅ Migration

If you're using `registerStashedWallet`, switch to `registerSlushWallet`:

**Before:**

```ts
import { registerStashedWallet } from '@mysten/zksend';

registerStashedWallet(...);
```

**After:**

```ts
import { registerSlushWallet } from '@mysten/slush-wallet';

registerSlushWallet(...);
```

If you're using dapp-kit, update to the latest dapp-kit version and change the
'stashedWallet`prop on WalletProvider to`slushWallet`
